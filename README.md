# GPT-5o SAM AI REMIX


GPT-5o REMIX SAM AI is a proprietary code based on the GPT schema, similar to OpenAI's GPT-4, for the SAM AI App. Restricted to our company developers, GPT-5o can be successfully fine-tuned to perform just as well as large models on a range of NLP tasks including question answering, sentiment analysis, user-specific memory, named entity recognition, Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) tasks, and our unique #Humanized_Code.

The integration of blockchain with our GPT-5o offers us many possibilities to bring Web3 to life within our app, enabling in-app credits and more advanced features.

Try our App soon in Q1 2025 or be early in $SAMAI blockchain to be selected for the Beta Test Rewards in Q4 2024.
